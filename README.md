# Homework4

This was meant to be my quiz applet, but I was unable to put in the time necessary to make the project complete.

I was able to set up the HTML and CSS to give the proper representation, 
and stage the elements and variables in what I believe is the proper way.

I was unable to put the functions together in a way that was complete enough to consider this a success.
Though I was able to get some functions working, I was not able to bring them together into a working project.

I'm sorry for the shoddy work on this project, I have been sick with a flu for the past couple of days, and it has limited my ability
to focus on the work at hand.  I owe you a really nice project on the next homework, and will set up some tutoring time to make sure
I am able to complete this project.

The display has been built with HTML and CSS, alongside bootstrap for responsiveness.  I used Javascript with jQuery to build the back
end functionality, but was only able to get to the point where I could manipulate the DOM into changing from the main screen to the "test"
screen.

script.JS was my original attempt and some notes that got left in when I pushed the project.
